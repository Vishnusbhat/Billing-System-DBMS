      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Billing System as a web application using the Node.js and React frameworks for the frontend, and MySQL as the database management system. The system aims to efficiently manage and streamline the process of billing, invoicing, and maintaining item and store details. It will provide a user-friendly interface for store managers and administrators, simplifying tasks such as generating bills, creating invoices, and maintaining accurate records of items and stores. Additionally, the system will enable detailed tracking and reporting of sales and transactions, offering valuable insights for business decision-making. The end goal is to create a robust tool that enhances the efficiency of the billing process, ensures accuracy in transactions, and provides valuable data for business operations and customer management.</p>
